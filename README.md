# ProjectInfo
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Tools for Esri's End Users

This is an (<sup>*</sup>semi-)open source project for re-creating Esri's Advance Tools with only a Basic license.
Why not to implement everything with open source libraries?
Because a lot of end-users knows only to work with esri's setup, without installing any libraries. Else, they can use QGIS, which is very good as an open source replacement.


## Future Work:

---
<sup>*</sup>semi-open source - To use this tools, you are still recure to have a basic esri license.
